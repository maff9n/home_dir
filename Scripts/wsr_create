# PURPOSE OF THIS SCRIPT
# This script is meant to speed up the weekly process of creating a WSR or similar texts.
# Especially users who maintain a remote wiki for those documents should profit. 
# For a user who is only focused on writing an email this script will still spare him some seconds but might be a slight over kill.
# 
# This script creates a WSR file, opens an editor, on close of the editor an email is sketched and help for maintaining the remote wiki repository is offered.
#
# If this script speeded up the WSR managment for you aswell, I'd love to hear from you.
# Regards Marvin


###
### The following variable you need to change.
###


#The Name that is shown at the end of the WSR file
name="Marvin"


###
### The following variables you may wanna change.
###


#Path where the WSR file is created. Potentially the path to the local wiki repository
local_directory="."

#Path to the home file of my wiki 
wiki_home_file="./home"

#Path to the editor to use
editor=/bin/vim

#The default name for the WSR file is set to the following
default_file_name="$(date +"WSR%G-W%U")"


###
### The gitlab_name and repository_name you need to change if you wanna include a link to the remote wiki repository WSR file in your WSR email.
###


#Only used when Option GITLAB_LINK is set to true...
#My Gitlab name 
gitlab_name="mmann"

#Only used when Option GITLAB_LINK is set to true...
#My Gitlab repository where the remote wiki lives
repository_name="wsr"

#Only used when Option GITLAB_LINK is set to true...
#Path to the remote wiki repository
wiki="https://gitlab.vpn.cyberus-technology.de/$gitlab_name/$repository_name/-/wikis"


###
### Options - These options match the main use case for user that maintain a wiki. Feel free tho set them to false if the don't match your use case.
###


# Include a link to the remote wiki in your WSR email
# true = include it
# false = don't include it
GITLAB_LINK=true

# Once you leave the editor and the email is opend it is assumed, that your next step in the shell is to push the newly added file to your remote wiki repository.
# Additinaly it is assumed that the link that was included in the email is of no need in the wiki and so the script attempts to remove the line containing the link before you push it to the remote wiki repository.
# true = remove the link in the WSR file
# false = don't remove the link in the WSR file 
ASK_TO_REMOVE_LINK=true

# Right before the script is done - head to your local wiki repository.
# you immediately wanna push your changes to the remote wiki repository (adds target of the link included in the file)
# true = cds to the directory $dir
# false = doesn't change the shell's current location
CD_AFTER_EDDITING=true

OPEN_HOME_FILE=true
