### home_dir

#  This repository isn't up to date since I swiched fully to nixOS and home-manager. As soon as I do not fear security risks anymore I will publish my full nixOS & home-manager config.


This repository is meant to unify my linux distributions and let me keep my customizations consistent.  
This repository is mainly controlling:
- i3 (blocks)
- zsh
- neovim
- tmux

#### Components to install

- i3
- i3 blocks 
- i3lock
- imagemagick
- redshift-gtk
- pulseaudio pavucontrol
- zsh
- oh-my-zsh
- ffmpeg

#### What else to do

- Extend .profile with .profile_extension
- Extend .bashrc or zshrc or ... with .shell_extension

#### What I need to do next to improve this repository

- setup copy/paste with the different buffers of vim
- setup rofi
- setup devicons                                      
- git extension inside vim
